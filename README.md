ðŸŒ¿ Bioelectricity Generation Using Spirulina Algae
Led the development of a sustainable bioelectricity system by cultivating Spirulina algae in a custom nutrient-rich medium. The culture was formulated using:

Base ingredients:

Drinking water, sea salt, bicarbonate of soda, and CaClâ‚‚ (calcium chloride)

Essential minerals to stimulate growth and electrical output:

Potassium nitrate, monoammonium phosphate, iron sulfate, potassium sulfate (optional), and magnesium sulfate (optional)

This biochemical environment was optimized to enhance the metabolic activity of Spirulina, enabling it to produce measurable voltage through microbial fuel cell principles. The setup demonstrated how bioelectricity can be harvested from living organisms under controlled conditions.

ðŸ“± Smart Monitoring Platform for Growth & Voltage Tracking
Designed and deployed a web and mobile application to monitor the algae cultureâ€™s performance in real time. The platform featured:

Daily growth reports based on visual and quantitative metrics

Voltage output tracking, recorded under varying environmental conditions:

Luminous intensity

Humidity

Ambient temperature

Sunlight exposure

Artificial lighting conditions
